## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) installed on your Linux system:

```bash
# Check if GCC is installed
gcc --version

# If not installed, install it:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gcc
```

### Quick Start

1. **Read the Learning Guide**: Start with `c_learning_guide.md` for comprehensive explanations
2. **Try the Examples**: Navigate to the `examples/` directory and try the sample programs
3. **Compile and Run**: Use the provided Makefile for easy compilation

### Running the Examples

#### Method 1: Using the Makefile (Recommended)
```bash
cd examples/

# Compile all programs
make all

# Or compile and run individual programs
make run-hello     # Hello World program
make run-calc      # Calculator
make run-temp      # Temperature converter
make run-student   # Student records system

# Get help
make help

# Clean compiled files
make clean
```

#### Method 2: Manual Compilation
```bash
cd examples/

# Compile a program
gcc hello_world.c -o hello_world

# Run the program
./hello_world
```

## 📚 Learning Path

### Beginner (Start Here!)
1. **Hello World** (`examples/hello_world.c`)
   - Basic program structure
   - Using `printf()`
   - Compilation process

2. **Calculator** (`examples/calculator.c`)
   - Variables and data types
   - User input with `scanf()`
   - Control structures (switch-case)

### Intermediate
3. **Temperature Converter** (`examples/temperature_converter.c`)
   - Functions and function prototypes
   - Modular programming
   - More complex logic

4. **Student Records** (`examples/student_records.c`)
   - Structures and arrays
   - Menu-driven programs
   - String handling

### Advanced Topics (After Mastering Basics)
- Pointers and memory management
- File I/O operations
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Linked lists and data structures

## 🛠️ Compilation Tips

### Basic Compilation
```bash
gcc program.c -o program_name
```

### With Warning Flags (Recommended)
```bash
gcc -Wall -Wextra -std=c99 program.c -o program_name
```

### Debug Mode
```bash
gcc -g -Wall program.c -o program_name
```

## 📖 Study Approach

1. **Read First**: Go through the relevant section in `c_learning_guide.md`
2. **Code Along**: Type out the examples yourself (don't copy-paste!)
3. **Experiment**: Modify the code and see what happens
4. **Practice**: Try the exercises at the end of each section
5. **Build**: Create your own programs using the concepts learned

## 🎯 Practice Exercises

After going through the examples, try these challenges:

### Beginner Exercises
- Modify the calculator to handle more operations
- Add error checking to the temperature converter
- Create a simple guessing game

### Intermediate Exercises
- Add more features to the student records system
- Create a simple text-based menu system
- Write a program to manage a small library

### Advanced Exercises
- Implement a basic inventory management system
- Create a simple text editor
- Build a file organizer tool

## 🔧 Debugging Tips

### Common Compilation Errors
- **Missing semicolon**: Each statement must end with `;`
- **Undeclared variables**: Declare variables before using them
- **Type mismatches**: Ensure variable types match their usage
- **Missing headers**: Include necessary header files (`#include <stdio.h>`)

### Using GDB (GNU Debugger)
```bash
# Compile with debug symbols
gcc -g program.c -o program

# Run with debugger
gdb ./program
```
